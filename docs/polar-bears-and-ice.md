# The Impact of Changing Sea Ice Levels on Polar Bears
## Evaluating an Article by Susan Crockford

  This article begins by discussing how regions with the most dramatic sea ice declines have not documented any reduced polar bear health or survival. However, scientists like Andrew Derocher have claimed that their predictions are coming true, which refers to a climate change paper he published in 1993 regarding the impacts of climatic warming on polar bears (Stirling and Derocher, 1993). In this paper, declining body conditions, reduced cub survival, and lowered reproductive rates were observed, but they could not determine if they were a result of climate change. This article states that these changes seen today cannot be attributed to climate change as they have occurred in the past, when there was no sea ice breakup. With more research, it becomes clear that the arctic sea ice extent has been decreasing since satellite-based measurements began in the 1970s, indicating that the observed changes may have been due to climate change (Lindsey, 2020). 
  
 
  Later on, the article begins to discuss another prediction, with increased cannibalism, deaths by mass starvation, drowning and collapses, and then quickly states that none of these predictions came true (Stirling and Derocher, 2012). It is interesting to note that the evidence used to disprove those claims is an article written by the author of the article, and this is done frequently, with the references list containing five of her articles. Based on the references, the information appears to come from a wide range of recent sources, with a majority of them being from trusted journals. However, Crockford often uses small bits of information that support her claims without providing all the necessary context. This makes it crucial for the reader to investigate further, but this is not commonly done by the general public, especially when the cited sources are scientific research papers. 
  
  
  This article’s main goal is to discuss Steven Amstrup’s 2007 predictions, which stated that ⅔ of the polar bear population would be gone after ten years of 40% less summer ice (Amstrup, Marcot and Douglas, 2007). This article claims that the observed sea ice loss is much greater than what the sea ice experts predicted in 2007 (Figure 1) (Stroeve et al., 2007). Similar climate change denier articles have argued that sea ice is not declining, highlighting the lack of a cohesive narrative (Gosselin, 2021). Later on in the article, the author states that there is no explanation for the failed predictions but the published paper clearly explains that the different subpopulations are expected to decline at different rates (Stirling and Derocher, 2012). Crockford claims that the scientists failed to account for increased productivity along with the increase in harp seal numbers, but these factors are often difficult to predict (Peacock et al., 2013). Although the increased harp seal population has led to increased polar bear survival rates, this article fails to mention how Peacock et al. discuss decreased reproductive rates, which may be due to worsening ice conditions (Peacock et al., 2013).

Initially, the purpose of this article appears to be to inform the general public, but it later becomes clear that the purpose is to persuade the public that sea ice loss is not harmful to polar bears in any way. Various opinionated terms are used, such as “proclaimed”, “failed spectacularly”, “his chums”, and more (Crockford, 2021). The author should use balanced arguments while considering all evidence when informing the argument, unlike Crockford who subjectively presents information. Other studies have provided strong evidence, such as reduced sea-ice habitat, declining reproductive rates, and increased cannibalism, to demonstrate the impact of decreasing sea ice on polar bears (Molnár et al., 2010; Owen and Swaisgood, 2008). It is difficult to determine the exact impact of climate change on polar bears, numerous factors play a role such as changing food supply, human interactions, and different adaptation strategies in subpopulations so further studies would be useful.
